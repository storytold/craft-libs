# Local linesweeper 0.5.0 copy

This is the crates.io linesweeper 0.5.0 package (MIT OR Apache-2.0) with some files left out and the
local patches listed below. `.cargo_vcs_info.json` names the commit it was packaged from,
`824b0791a750f7b27b8edcbb6c6244d0e629875e`. That commit is not in the GitHub repository the manifest
names, which is archived; its README says development moved off GitHub.

Every file here except this one, `SOURCE.json` and the patched files below is byte for byte the file
in the `.crate` archive. `SOURCE.json` records the hash of the `.crate` download
(`source_archive_sha256`) and, for every file kept, the hash in the package (`source_sha256`) and the
hash here (`sha256`). `upstream_repository` is null because no public repository this copy can name
holds `upstream_revision`. `local_patches` describes each local patch.

## Local patches

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/sweep/sweep_line.rs` | `Sweeper::scan_for_removal` starts its intersection scans from the nearest segment left of the removed slot that does not end at the current `y`. Segments that end at `y` stay in the sweep line until `advance`, and a scan from one of them returns at once, so the live segments on both sides of the gap were never compared and their crossing was missed. The `removal_scan_skips_segments_that_end` test sweeps two integer polygons whose crossing at (0.75, 1.5) used to be missed; their Intersection came out with area 1.5 instead of 1.125. Both removal paths call this function: a segment's exit and the removals in `handle_intersection`. During the exits at one height, `EndedRun` keeps the walk to that segment, so many segments ending at one height do not each repeat it; `removal_scans_share_the_run_of_ended_segments` counts the positions visited. |

`omitted_files` lists the 43 files of the package left out here, with their hashes:

- `tests/fonts/Inconsolata-Regular.ttf`: font files live in craft-fonts.
- `docs/assets/logo.svg` and `examples/linebender.svg`: the package gives no license for this artwork
  apart from its `license` field.
- `tests/snapshots/`: 12 SVG and 20 PNG files.
- `.config/`, `.helix/`, `.typos.toml`, `.gitmodules`, `flake.nix`, `flake.lock` and `nix/`: the
  package's repository tooling.

Only the targets listed under Tests read the font, the logos and the snapshot files, and those targets
do not compile from the published package.

## Using it

The directory is excluded from the workspace. With the root manifest's `[patch.crates-io]` entry,
`craft-prepress` builds its `flatten` feature against this copy. Cargo ignores a dependency's patches,
so a consuming workspace adds its own entry:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
linesweeper = { git = "https://github.com/storytold/craft-libs", rev = "<rev>" }
```

## Tests

`scripts/test-pdf-backends.sh` runs the package's unit, regression and doc tests. The `craft-prepress`
tests with the `flatten` feature run against this copy. `pdf.yml`'s path filter does not list this
directory, so a pull request that changes only files here does not start `pdf.yml`. Run the tests from
this directory:

```sh
cargo test --locked --lib --test regression
cargo test --locked --doc
```

`Cargo.toml` leaves out the `kompari`, `linesweeper_util` and `path-bool` dev-dependencies, which
`Cargo.toml.orig` gives as git or path dependencies. The `fonts` and `snapshots` tests, the
`winding-numbers` and `boolean_op` examples and the `linebender_logo` bench do not compile here.

Cargo writes to `target/` in this directory, which the root `.gitignore` excludes.
